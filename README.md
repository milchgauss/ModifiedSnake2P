# ModifiedSnake2P

I program primarily in Java and became interested in learning more about the p5.js library in Javascript.


Using the source code from this tutorial: https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial
I created a modified version of the classic game "Snake" to include **two players.** 

The two snake objects can also interact with one another by **biting the tail or head of the other.**

**When this happens, the game ends.**


**The controls for player one are:**
\n Upkey= Go up
Rightkey= Go right
Downkey= Go down
Leftkey = Go left


**The controls for player two are:**
w= Go up
a= Go left
d= Go right
s= Go down
